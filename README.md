# TombManyGraves
Adds (configurable) graves to Minecraft 1.9

Please note that this mod has been updated to 1.9.4 here (https://github.com/M4thG33k/TombManyGraves_1.9.4)
I am a noob and could not figure out how to do the upgrade in one repository; any insight into this would be very helpful. Thanks!
